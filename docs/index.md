# Introduction to Machine Learning

Welcome to **Introduction to Machine Learning**! This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of machine learning, covering both theory and practical implementation.

## Course Overview

This course will cover:

- Fundamental concepts in machine learning
- Linear regression and optimization
- Neural networks and deep learning
- Practical implementation using Python

!!! note "Prerequisites"
    Students should have basic knowledge of:

    - Linear algebra (vectors, matrices)
    - Calculus (derivatives, gradients)
    - Python programming

!!! warning "Workload"
    This is an intensive course. Expect to spend approximately 10-15 hours per week on lectures, readings, and assignments.

## Course Structure

The course consists of:

- **Lectures**: 3 comprehensive lecture modules
- **Labs**: 2 hands-on programming assignments
- **Exams**: Midterm and final examinations

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Understand core machine learning concepts and algorithms
2. Implement machine learning models from scratch
3. Apply ML techniques to real-world problems
4. Evaluate and optimize model performance

!!! important "Academic Integrity"
    All work submitted must be your own. Collaboration is encouraged for understanding concepts, but code and writeups must be individual work.

## Getting Started

Begin with [Lecture 1 - Introduction](lectures/01-introduction.md) to learn the basics of machine learning.
